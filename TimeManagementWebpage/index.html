            <p>Priotization is tricky. Looking at it from different perspectives can bring you some helpful insights. When thinking about if something should be done or not, compare it to the future. With each segment, ask yourself this: Am I on track?</p>

            <dd><p>Use a tool to find out what is really important and needs to get done</p>
                <p>Sometimes, prioritizing is difficult. Therefore, tools sometimes make the process easier by applying a set of standards to each priority and evaluating without bias or unreal expectations.</p></dd>
            <dt><strong>Setting Boundaries</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Use goal setting to help limit your "Yes"s and "No"s and increase the likelihood of success</p>
                <p>It's proven that by setting mini-goals you are more likely to achieve your goals. However, there are some techniques that already include this and are said to be even more effective, like <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound/Timely">SMART</abbr> goals.</p></dd>
            <dt><strong>Dare to Say No</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Be strong and don't budge on certain "No"s</p>
                <p>Discipline is difficult as it is. Saying "No" shouldn't be made tough. Most times, it should be effortless and free and doubt.</p></dd>

                <p>How are you expected to know what to change or how you've changed without putting a focus on how you've adapted? Using a self-selected method to reflect can be a game-changer for acknowledging those small wins or losses and using them to build better strategies for success.</p></dd>
