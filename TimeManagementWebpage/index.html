            <h4>Essentialism Goal Mindset</h4>
            <p>Priotization is tricky. Looking at it from different perspectives can bring you some helpful insights. When thinking about if something should be done or not, compare it to the future. With each segment, ask yourself this: Am I on track?</p>

            <dt>Specific</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A goal needs to be specific. Among other reasons, it allows you to track your goal better and avoid future confusion. You should at least ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do I want to achieve?</li>
                    <li>Why is this goal important?</li>
                    <li>Who is participating?</li>
                    <li>Where is it located?</li>
                    <li>Which resources or limits are involved?</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Measurable</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A goal also needs to be measurable both by definition and from an evaluation perspective to track your progress. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much?</li>
                    <li>How many?</li>
                    <li>How will I know if I am on track?</li>
                    <li>How will I know if I have accomplished my goals?</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Achievable</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Your goal should be able to answer these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you afford this?</li>
                    <li>Do you have the skills needed?</li>
                    <li>Do you have the resources required?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Tip: Your goal should not be dependent upon someone else. It should be entirely focused on your own abilities and power.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Realistic</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Does your goal fit? Is it you? Don't overlook these important qualities of a realistic goal. Your goal should have <strong>all</strong> of these traits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>worthwhile</li>
                    <li>cost:benefit approved</li>
                    <li>matches personality</li>
                    <li>currently desirable in socio-economic environment</li>
                    <li>right goal for the right moment</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Time-bound</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Your goal needs a deadline. This helps you create time-oriented mini-goals. Your goal should answer these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When?</li>
                    <li>What should I do now?</li>
                </ul>
