            <dd><p>Use a tool to find out what is really important and needs to get done</p>
                <p>Sometimes, prioritizing is difficult. Therefore, tools sometimes make the process easier by applying a set of standards to each priority and evaluating without bias or unreal expectations.</p></dd>
            <dt><strong>Setting Boundaries</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Use goal setting to help limit your "Yes"s and "No"s and increase the likelihood of success</p>
                <p>It's proven that by setting mini-goals you are more likely to achieve your goals. However, there are some techniques that already include this and are said to be even more effective, like <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound/Timely">SMART</abbr> goals.</p></dd>
            <dt><strong>Dare to Say No</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Be strong and don't budge on certain "No"s</p>
                <p>Discipline is difficult as it is. Saying "No" shouldn't be made tough. Most times, it should be effortless and free and doubt.</p></dd>

            <dd><p>Reflect and adapt to what works and doesn't work</p>
                <p>How are you expected to know what to change or how you've changed without putting a focus on how you've adapted? Using a self-selected method to reflect can be a game-changer for acknowledging those small wins or losses and using them to build better strategies for success.</p></dd>
